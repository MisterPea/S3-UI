#### Forthcoming Ideas
* Login Auth: [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/)
* Add files with/without [folders](https://web.dev/patterns/files/drag-and-drop-directories/)
* Retrieve files via link. Might be using s3 api, though would be cool to custom server
* Upload/Download files
* Add/Delete folders
* Add/Delete buckets
* File Preview. Might be good to store a low-res or snippet. (Might not be worth doing)
